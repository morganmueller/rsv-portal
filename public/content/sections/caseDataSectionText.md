##  Page Overview

All clinical laboratories that perform testing on NYC residents report positive COVID-19 test results electronically to DOHMH. [Insert info here on probable cases.] Differences across seasons in the volume of positive laboratory reports reflect changes not only in the volume of infections, but also in patient care seeking and laboratory testing and reporting practices.
