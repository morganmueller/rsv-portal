##  Page Overview

Positive COVID-19, influenza, and RSV laboratory results must be reported to the NYC Health Department. However, these do not include some rapid tests or tests performed at home. Other factors can influence whether the NYC Health department receives positive test results, so these data may not accurately reflect the amount of illness among NYC residents.
