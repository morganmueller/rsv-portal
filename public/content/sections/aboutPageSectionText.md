## About the Tracker
This portal brings together emergency department trends, lab-confirmed cases, and COVID‑19 deaths for NYC. Data are updated weekly, with small‑count suppression and other protections.  
Details on sources, methods, and limitations are below.



## About the data
Data are updated every Thursday with data through the previous Saturday. All data are preliminary and may change as more information is received. Counts less than 5 are suppressed to maintain confidentiality.  
Access to care and other factors can influence ED visits and lab-reported cases; these data may not perfectly reflect illness among NYC residents.

## Archived data on respiratory illnesses in NYC
You can find data published prior to **[date of launch]** on our COVID‑19 data page and in the Weekly Influenza and RSV Surveillance Summaries. Additional data are available through **EpiQuery** for respiratory infections and ED visits.

## Emergency department visits and hospitalizations
Near–real‑time data from all 52 NYC EDs use diagnosis codes to identify respiratory complaints (e.g., cough) or illnesses like pneumonia, helping track trends in illness and care‑seeking.

## Laboratory-reported cases
Clinical laboratories report positive test results for COVID‑19, influenza, and RSV to the NYC Health Department as required by the NYC Health Code.

## COVID‑19 deaths
Currently we present all‑ages death data for COVID‑19 only (no national guidance for adult influenza/RSV deaths).  
A death is counted as COVID‑19 if:
- The death certificate lists COVID‑19 (or equivalent) as underlying or contributing cause, **or**
- A case investigation for a confirmed/probable/suspect case determined COVID‑19 caused or contributed to the death.

## Influenza‑associated pediatric deaths
All deaths in children under 18 associated with influenza are reported to the NYC Health Department, as required by the NYC Health Code.

## Health inequities
Race/ethnicity data are often incomplete in ED and lab reports (most complete for COVID‑19 cases and deaths). The Health Department continues to improve completeness.  
Differences in outcomes among racial and ethnic groups stem from long‑term structural racism—not biology or personal traits—limiting access to resources and opportunities and affecting health.
