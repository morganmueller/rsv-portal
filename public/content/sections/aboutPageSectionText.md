## About the Tracker
The Respiratory Illness Data pages show data on COVID-19, influenza, and RSV in New York City collected by the NYC Health Department.  



## About the data
Data are updated every Thursday with data through the previous Saturday. All data are preliminary and may change as more information is received. Counts less than 5 are suppressed to maintain confidentiality. 

Access to care and other factors can influence the number of emergency department visits as well as laboratory-reported cases received by the NYC Health Department, so these data may not accurately reflect the amount of illness among NYC residents.  

For more detailed information on the data, files, and collection methods, visit our GitHub repository [+link when established]. 

## Archived data on respiratory illnesses in NYC
You can find data published prior to [date of launch] on our [COVID-19 data page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) and in the [Weekly Influenza and RSV Surveillance Summaries](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/health-topics/flu-alerts.page).  

Additional data are also available through EpiQuery for [respiratory infections](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ts&PopulationSource=CDSD&Topic=1&Subtopic=41) and [emergency department visits](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ts&PopulationSource=CDSD&Topic=1&Subtopic=41).  

## Emergency department visits and hospitalizations
The Health Department receives near real-time data from all 52 emergency departments in NYC. The emergency departments share diagnosis codes which can be used to identify general respiratory complaints such as cough or illnesses such as pneumonia. This information helps us see trends in illness and care-seeking among NYC residents. Laboratory-reported cases 

All clinical laboratories that perform testing on NYC residents report positive test results electronically for a number of infectious diseases including COVID-19, influenza, and RSV to the NYC Health Department, as required by law in the [NYC Health Code](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/reporting-and-services/notifiable-diseases-and-conditions-reporting-central.page).  

## Laboratory-reported cases
All clinical laboratories that perform testing on NYC residents report positive test results electronically for a number of infectious diseases including COVID-19, influenza, and RSV to the NYC Health Department, as required by law in the [NYC Health Code](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/reporting-and-services/notifiable-diseases-and-conditions-reporting-central.page).  

## COVID‑19 deaths
Currently, we are presenting all-ages death data for COVID-19 only. There is no national surveillance guidance to define influenza- or RSV-related deaths among adults.  

Deaths are counted as a COVID-19 death if: 

* The death certificate lists COVID-19 or an equivalent term as the underlying or a contributing cause of death, or  

* A case investigation for a confirmed, probable, or suspect COVID-19 case determined that COVID-19 was the cause of death or contributed to the death 

## Influenza‑associated pediatric deaths
All deaths in children under 18 associated with influenza are reported to the NYC Health Department, as required by the [NYC Health Code](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/reporting-and-services/notifiable-diseases-and-conditions-reporting-central.page).

## Health inequities
Data received from emergency departments and electronic laboratory reports often lack information on demographic characteristics, such as race and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity information is most complete for COVID-19 cases and deaths. The NYC Health Department continues to work to improve completeness of this information for other illnesses.  

Differences in health outcomes among racial and ethnic groups are due to long-term structural racism, not biological or personal traits. Structural racism — centuries of racist policies and discriminatory practices across institutions, including government agencies, and society — prevents communities of color from accessing vital resources (such as health care, housing and food) and opportunities (such as employment and education), and negatively affects overall health and well-being.

## Respiratory Virus Seasonality
COVID‑19 and influenza follow seasonal trends, peaking in colder months. RSV tends to affect infants and older adults in fall/winter.

## Data Transparency
All data in this portal are pulled from NYC surveillance systems and regularly updated. We aim to provide accurate, clear, and actionable insights to the public and health professionals alike.
